Objective:

Churn Prediction (Who cancel their subscription within the next year?)
A model is trained on the basis of past terminations, which predicts the affinity for termination per order.

Use Case:

Churn prevention mailing: we see addressing via the email channel can, with the right communication, prevent our subscribers from canceling. 
But since we don't want to ‘delight’ our customers excessively with emails, only the deciles who are inclined to cancel receive this measure by email.

Data set: 

 - The subscription orders for ZEIT and ZEIT Digital from the years> 2012 were considered
 - Explanatory variables come from the following areas: purchase completion, payment behavior, subscription and object type, ZEIT shop, demographics, newsletter and email performance

Dimensions:

- about 170 features
- 175k assignments
